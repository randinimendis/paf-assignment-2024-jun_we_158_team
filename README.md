#### Brief Description of your Solution - 
The project assigned to our group is to create a fitness-focused social media network. This website 
attempts to give users a specific area where they can share exercises, fitness journeys, and healthy living 
advice. Users can post workout status updates, trade training programme, and even reveal their meal 
plans—complete with recipes and dietary details—by uploading images and videos that highlight their 
actions through a smooth interface. Our objective is to enable people to monitor their advancement, 
motivate others, and establish connections with a community of like-minded fitness lovers, all while 
emphasizing ease of use and personalization.
